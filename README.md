# Colour-Detection
ML- Python 

In this color detection Python project, an application has been built, through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. Whenever a double click event occurs, it will update the color name and RGB values on the window. So for this, a data file has been used that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
